## Introduction

Angel Trading Co. is a project that seeks to provide collectors with a place to trade and find others that are also interested in trading. We hope to give collectors and enthusiasts a centralized place where they can find other local collectors to trade with. Currently we are focusing on supporting Smiski and Sunny Angel communities!
